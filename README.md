# Alexa, make things complicated.

With this long-term project my main priority will be to have fun. But I'd also like for this to serve as my way to show my self-learning journey in understanding Python, as well as expanding my understanding of APIs and handling http requests.


## Goal - :joystick:

Have you ever wanted to play a browser game, but the controllers were discord commands? Me either, but at least we'll have the option soon!

This project was originally going to be a simple meme bot, with its only functionality being **`Alexa, play despacito`**.  Once I realized how insanely simple handling a discord bot was (*shoutout discord.py and discord for such a great API and wrapper*) it was time to sparkle on needlessly complications onto my project!

## Progress - :chart_with_upwards_trend:
I'll aim to update as I go, and do a final write-up on the project once its in a shareable state.

After a night of learning how to use flask and sqlalchemy (shoutout freeCodeCamp) and looking at discord.py's documentation, I was able to send a basic **get** request from a discord command towards my locally hosted flask server.
